## Write-up

When we navigate to ``23.226.239.10``, we are greeted with a SuperMicro IPMI server login page. Looking up SuperMicro IPMI vulnerabilities, we stumble upon this link [] (). It details that the plaintext password to the admin interface on IPMI devices can be accessed by connecting to the ????? and running ``GET /PSBlock``.

```bash
$ telnet 23.226.239.10 49152
GET /PSBlock

```
