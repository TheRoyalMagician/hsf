# CSAW HSF 2016 Prelims: Napolean's (Seer)Sucky Intern

**Category:** File & Disk Forensics
**Points:** 400
**Solves:** 13
**Description:**

> We (an unnamed hospital) hired an intern that we thought would be great because he won some high school hacker challenge.
> Turns out he was terrible, came on, downloaded some random open source EMR stuff, then went on vacation to Charleston.
> Now that he's gone, we've noticed all kinds of weird traffic coming from his machine, but no real evidence that he did much with it. Can you help us figure out what's going on?
